test 0.2 here

## Testing sections

Here I'm testing something

### Did it work?

The title above should be indented in the right-side bar

#### Yes, it did

## Features

- Introduce errors in the data
- How to store data: DBs (SQLite, PostgreSQL), files (parquet, csv, txt)
- How to use it: Visualisation, monitoring, dashboards, reports

---

Whatever system I come up with it needs to respect some constraints:

 - The package needs to represent a system of product change, adoption, and decay (or not). It should not be "seen" in the generated data, but should be held somewhere to be used when respecting established trends.
 - This means that the generated data, when analysed at any given point in time, should reflect a realistic scenario.

 ---

 - This system, therefore will be based on 3 pilars: trends, state, and interaction.
    1. High-level and low-level trends will be established, respected, and modified through time by the user and automatically.
    2. State values will represent preferences and moments in time in terms of decision-making for all users. Point-based system, threshold value <-- These through time are trends.
    3. There will be an action, interaction, and reaction to fake company initiatives and user initatives.

The project will be defined if it serves consumers, businesses, or both. After it is created, this can be modified (upscaling to only businesses or offering cheaper consumer options from only B2B).


## Code test

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

## Footnote test & emoji! :smile:

This text[^1] is interesting.

## Roadmap

* [x] this task is done
* [ ] this one isn't.

## Maths

I can do some maths $a + b < c$ inline.

$$ a + c^2 < b^7 $$
